# Toy NLP projects based on recipe data from Epicurious found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes)

I trained models to detect mentions of food in recipes as an example of Named Entity Recognition. You can play with a live demo and read about the training process [here.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/carolanderson/food-ner)

I also trained XGBoost-based classification models to categorize recipes as vegan, gluten-free, or kosher. I've since taken down the live demos and blog posts about those models.
