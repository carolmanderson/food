# Toy NLP projects based on recipe data from Epicurious found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes)

I trained a simple LSTM-based model to detect mentions of food in recipes as an example of Named Entity Recognition. 

I also trained XGBoost-based classification models to categorize recipes as vegan, gluten-free, or kosher.

Please see my blog posts about these projects [here.](http://www.hiddenlayercake.com)


You can play with the models in the interactive web app [here.](http://54.213.148.85:8501)
